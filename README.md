# LetterboxdDataToSQL
On the movie website Letterboxd you can pull your data so that you can analyze it, but some of the information you might want will not be in the file when you pull it and it might not be in a place where you want it. These files provide you with methods to add information and transfer information with this data. There is Python code to add the director information to the file you download since it does not come with that already. There is also SQL code that can transfer the csv file with information into SQL. You could also use pandas in Python to do some analysis but I prefer SQL. There is also a few SQL queries that will get you information, such as your highest rated directors sorted by average rating and number of movies seen, the average rating for years/decades, and directors with the biggest deviation in scores.
